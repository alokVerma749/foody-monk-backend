# foody-monk Backend

This is the backend repository for the foody-monk food ordering app. It provides the server-side implementation and API endpoints required for the app to function.

The frontend repository for foody-monk can be found [here](https://github.com/alokVerma749/foody-monk).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run server-side JavaScript code.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, used to build the RESTful API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL document database used to store and retrieve data for the app.
- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB, providing a simple and elegant way to interact with the database.
- **jsonwebtoken**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication and authorization.
- **bcrypt**: Bcrypt is used for password hashing to securely store user passwords.
- **multer**: Multer is used for handling file uploads.
- **dotenv**: Dotenv is used to manage environment variables.
